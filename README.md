### ðŸ“Œ  tracki orgin story  
- tracki is being developed by a Seattle-based computer science graduate student, 
with a background in engineering and construction. 

- tracki was born out of personal experience and frustration with using excel to gather
information on 60+ permits every week. 

- Making custom reports and pivot tables takes forever and kept information siloed in a 
weekly report.

- After leaving the construction industry, Nars has been working on tracki in her free time 
as a labor of love, and plans to at least have the New Orleans site live by Spring 2024.
